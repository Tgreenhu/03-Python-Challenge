In this assignment, we were given multiple tasks to complete using Python.

PyBank:
Given a CSV file of months & profit/losses per month, I pulled out the following data:
    - Total number of months
    - New profit or loss of the entire period
    - Average change of profit/losses over the entire period
    - Greatest increase & decrease in losses (along with the month and year for both)

PyPoll:
Given a CSV file of voter IDs, county, and candidate, I pull out the following data:
    - Total number of votes
    - The complete list of candidates receiving votes, including number & percentage of votes for each
    - The winner of the election

PyBoss:
Given a CSV file of employee IDs, names, date of biths, SSNs, and states, I performed the following tasks to convert the CSV file into the required format:
    - Split name column into First Name and Last Name columns
    - Formatted the DOB from yyyy-mm-dd to mm/dd/yyyy
    - Formatted the SSN to hide all but the last 4 digits of every SSN
